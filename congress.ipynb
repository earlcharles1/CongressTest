In addition, the VA must enter into a partnership with at least one cancer center of the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health in each Veterans Integrated Service Network to expand access to high-quality cancer care for women veterans. In implementing such partnerships, the VA must ensure that veterans with breast cancer who reside in rural areas or states without a partner cancer center are able to receive care through telehealth.

The bill generally prohibits the importation of Russian products that are classified under chapter 27 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (which includes mineral fuels, mineral oils and products of their distillation, bituminous substances, and mineral waxes), with an exception for prior contracts or agreements. The President may waive this prohibition for national interest reasons, subject to congressional approval.

Additionally, the bill statutorily authorizes broader coverage of current visa- and property-blocking sanctions for human rights violations to cover persons involved in serious human rights abuses. (Current law imposes these sanctions on persons responsible for gross violations of human rights, a higher standard.) The bill authorizes the President to impose sanctions on any foreign person who (1) is responsible for serious human rights abuse, (2) is a current or former government official who is responsible for or complicit in corruption, (3) is or has been a leader or official of an entity that has engaged in any of these activities, (4) has provided support for any of these activities, or (5) is owned or controlled by a person subject to these sanctions.</td>\n",

After the investigation, the State Department must convene a coordinating committee to review the investigation report and make findings about, for example, the adequacy of security measures and the impact of intelligence and information availability. Members of the committee must be Assistant Secretary-level officials at the State Department, including the Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security, the Assistant Secretary responsible for the region where the incident occurred, and other designated officials.
